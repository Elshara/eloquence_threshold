2.	Raw mode

When text is sent to this driver in "raw" mode, no checking is done for character sets.

You can insert Dolphin Orpheus TTS commands in the text by entering @<p=n> where p is the parameter number and n is the new value. For example, to set the pitch to 100Hz you could enter @<1=100>.

The thirteen parameters and their valid ranges are:

 0 - speed              10 to  700
 1 - pitch              50 to  500
 2 - skim reading level  0 to    8
 3 - word pause          0 to 1000
 4 - phrase pause        0 to 2000
 5 - voice               *
 6 - volume              0 to  100
 7 - balance          -100 to  100
 8 - bass             -100 to  100
 9 - treble           -100 to  100
10 - language            ** 
11 - exceptions          0 or    1
12 - anomalies           0 or    1

* This command takes a voice-in-current language index.  For example @<5=01> would switch to the second voice in UK English, if UK English is the currently selected voice in Orpheus.

** This command takes language code numbers to switch language. For example @<10=44> would switch to UK English if it is installed.

In addition, @<0=0> will disable the voice block passed with a non-raw mode call, @<0=1> will enable processing of the voice block.

When you use raw mode, the voice block and spelling flag are  ignored. However, index marks should work in the same way. You cannot split a command between two append calls.
