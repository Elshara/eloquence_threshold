\Vce=Speaker=Reed\
Hello. My name is Reed.
I believe we may have met before.
Have you met my sister Shelley? 

\Vce=Speaker=Shelley\
Hello.  I'm Shelley.
Later you'll meet some more of our family,  but first, let me tell 
you about our jobs.
Humans feed us text, and we pronounce it with our synthetic voices.
We produce our voices with a set of rules.
Our human teachers keep improving our rules, so our speech gets
better and better.

\Vce=Speaker=Reed\
All of the sentences we've said so far were given to us as ordinary text.
We figured out the intonation patterns ourselves.  But users can change 
how we sound, with simple annotations.  

For example, users can tell us to emphasize a specific word in a sentence. 
Suppose another machine claimed to be the best talking computer.
I could then respond, \Pau=300\ no, \Pau=250\ \xWac=3\ I'm the best
talking computer.

Or if someone told me I was the best talking monster,
I could say \xPhf=ContinuationRise\, \Pau=250\ no, \Pau=250\ I'm the best
talking \xWac=3\ computer. \Pau=400\

\xWac=2\ Other \xWac=0\ annotations can help me to express my \xWac=2\ emotions.  
For example, if I were tired I could \xWac=0\ say,
\Spd=149\ \xPfl=36\ \Pit=73\  I'm feeling very slow today.
\Vce=Speaker=Reed\ Or if I were on a rocketship I could \xWac=0\ say,
\Pau=250\ \xPfl=37\ \Pit=346\ This is really exciting.  \Pau=400\

\Vce=Speaker=Reed\
The rest of our \xWac=0\ family
is just as expressive as we are.  
Let us introduce you to some of our \xWac=2\ other family members.

Our baby brother's \xWac=0\ name is Sandy.  He's still very little,
but he already talks \xWac=0\ really well.  

\Vce=Speaker=Sandy\
Where's my mommy?  \xPfl=31\ \Pit=405\ I lost my teddy bear.  

\Vce=Speaker=Reed\
And our grandmother is here too.  Hello \Pau=10\, Grandma.
\Vce=Speaker=Grandma\
Well \xWac=2\ hello Reed \xPhf=SmallRise\.  You're such a good grandson,
and you're \xWac=1\ so eloquent.  
Your father would've been very proud of you.  

\Vce=Speaker=Reed\
Thanks, Grandma.
There are other members of our family too.

You can easily change any of us to customize our voices for \xWac=2\ your needs.
\xHsz=100\ \Pit=86\ For example, you can make me bigger so I'll sound like a giant.
\Vce=Speaker=Sandy\ \xRgh=60\ Or you can make Sandy sound \xWac=0\ 
like he has a \xWac=0\ sore throat.
\Vce=Speaker=Grandpa\ \Spd=265\ This is Grandpa talking really fast.
\Vce=Speaker=Shelley\ \xBth=100\ And this is Shelley whispering so she can tell you a secret.
\Vce=Speaker=Reed\ \Pit=422\ \Vol=15000\ This is Reed pretending to be a woman.
\Vce=Speaker=Sandy\ \Pit=235\ \xPfl=6\ And this is Sandy when he's really bored.

\Vce=Speaker=Reed\
In addition to customizing our voices... you can make us all talk at many
different speaking \xWac=0\  rates.  Listen:

\Spd=80\  Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
\Spd=176\  Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
\Spd=450\  Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

\Spd=176\
\Pau=1000\
So, as you can hear... our system gives you lots of flexibility in
customizing voices. 

You can even change voice parameters in the
middle of a sentence.  Listen:

This is \Vce=Speaker=Grandma\ Grandma \Vce=Speaker=Reed\  
and this is \Vce=Speaker=Grandpa\ Grandpa.

\Vce=Speaker=Reed\
Application developers really \xWac=2\ like this feature.  For example,
if you were creating a web browser, you could use a special
voice for \Vce=Speaker=Sandy\ \Pit=150\ \xHsz=65\ \xBth=70\ \Vol=65000\ 
hypertext \xWac=0\ links.

\Vce=Speaker=Reed\
Or you \xWac=1\ might switch voices to tell a story, like this.
Little red riding hood asked...
\Vce=Speaker=Sandy\ \xBth=20\ \xPfl=40\ "Why do you have such big eyes, grandmother?" 
\Vce=Speaker=Reed\ And the wolf answered... 
\PIT=95\ \xHsz=80\ \xPfl=50\ \Spd=150\ \Vol=65000\ the better 
to \xWac=2\ see you with, my dear."

\Vce=Speaker=Reed\
The possibilities are endless, but you've probably heard \xWac=2\ enough
for now.  
Goodbye, and thanks for listening.
