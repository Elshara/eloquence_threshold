# Speechdata migration manifest

This snapshot inventories the extensionless assets that remain under `speechdata/` after the repository-wide extension shuffle. Regenerate it with ``python assets/py/report_speechdata_inventory.py`` whenever files move. The data complements the NVDA-focused roadmap in [`assets/md/README.md`](README.md) and helps us plan the remaining migrations without breaking cached datasets or NVDA loaders.

## Migration notes

- Prioritise folders with â‰¥80% extensionless files when designing loader shims. They are most at risk of breakage if we force renames.
- When migrating DataJake or NV Speech Player corpora, document the new asset paths in [`assets/md/README.md`](README.md) and refresh the cached provenance dashboards before packaging `eloquence.nvda-addon`.
- For each subtree, record whether NVDA expects exact filenames. If so, extend the manifest helper to emit a `requires_exact_names` flag so CodeQL and packaging scripts can warn when extensions change.
