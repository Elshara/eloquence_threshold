# Repository Guidelines for `eloquence_threshold`

## Project identity
- This fork maintains and modernizes the ETI Eloquence 6.1 synthesizer for the NVDA screen reader on Windows 10 and Windows 11.
- Always acknowledge that the project originates from the NVDA community and aims to deliver low-latency speech comparable to classic Klatt-based synthesizers such as DECtalk.
- Document the motivation for the fork when relevant: NVDA's evolving Python requirements and add-on policies necessitate an actively maintained alternative.

## Documentation expectations
- Use clear, welcoming language that addresses blind and low-vision users as well as contributors.
- When updating documentation, include forward-looking plans for expanding beyond the historic eight default voices and for providing customizable phoneme controls through NVDA's voice dialog.
- Reference the NVDA upstream project (https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/) when discussing compatibility or testing expectations.
- Mention CodeQL usage whenever documenting security or quality assurance processes.

## Contribution notes
- Encourage community participation via issues and discussions, and invite contributors to help test against current and alpha NVDA builds.
- Keep instructions actionable for both users and developers, including any planned integration with resources such as eSpeak NG for additional language phonemes.

These guidelines apply to the entire repository.
