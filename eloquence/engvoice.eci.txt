Hello. My name is Justin.
I believe we may have met before.
Have you met my sister Jane? 

`v2
Hello.  I'm Jane.
Later you'll meet some more of our family,  but first, let me tell you about our jobs.
Humans feed us text, and we pronounce it with our synthetic voices.
We produce our voices with a set of rules.
Our human teachers keep improving our rules, so our speech gets better and better.

`v1
All of the sentences we've said so far were given to us as ordinary text.
We figured out the intonation patterns ourselves.  But users can change how we sound,
with simple annotations.  

For example, users can tell us to emphasize a specific word in a sentence. 
Suppose another machine claimed to be the best talking computer.
I could then respond, `p300 no, `p250 `3 I'm the best
talking computer.

Or if someone told me I was the best talking monster,
I could say `%%, `p250 no, `p250 I'm the best
talking `3 computer.  `p400

`2 Other `0 annotations can help me to express my `2 emotions.  
For example, if I were tired I could `0 say,
`vs42 `vf36 `vb45  I'm feeling very slow today.
`v1 Or if I were on a rocketship I could `0 say,
`p250 `vf37 `vb95 This is really exciting.  `p400

`v1
The rest of our `0 family is  just as `0
expressive as we are.  Let us introduce you to some of
our `2 other family members.

Our baby brother's `0 name is Nicky.  He's still very little,
but he already talks `0 really well.  

`v3
Where's my mommy?  `vf31 `vb98 I lost my teddy bear.  

`v1
And our grandmother is here too.  Hello `p10, `0 Nanny `%.

`v7
Well `2 hello Justin `%.  You're such a good grandson,
and you're `1 so eloquent.  
Your father would've been very proud of you.  

`v1
Thanks, `0 Nanny `%.
There are other members of our family too.

You can easily change any of us to customize our voices for `2 your needs.
`vh100 `vb55 For example, you can make me bigger so I'll sound like a giant.
`v3 `vr60 Or you can make Nicky sound `0 like he has a `0
sore throat.
`v8 `vs85 This is Gramps talking really fast.
`v2 `vy100 And this is Jane whispering so she can tell you a secret.
`v1 `vb100 `vv90 This is Justin pretending to be a woman.
`v3 `vb85 `vf6 And this is Nicky when he's really bored.

 `v1
In addition to customizing our voices... you can make us all talk at many
different speaking `0 rates.  Listen:

`vs10 Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
`vs50 Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
`vs120 Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. 

`vs50
`p1000
So, as you can hear... our system gives you lots of flexibility in
customizing voices. 

You can even change voice parameters in the
middle of a sentence.  Listen:

`v1 This is `v7 Nanny  `v1 and this is `v8 Gramps.

`v1
Application developers really `2  like this feature.  For example,
if you were creating a web browser, you could use a special
voice for `v3 `vb70 `vh65 `vy70 `vv100 hypertext `0 links.

`v1
Or you `1 might switch voices to tell a story, like this.
Little red riding hood asked...
`v3 `vy20 `vf40 "Why do you have such big eyes, grandmother?" 
`v1  And the wolf answered...
`v1 `vb60 `vh80 `vv100  `vs40  `vf50 "The better to `2 see you with, my dear."

`v1
The possibilities are endless, but you've probably heard `2 enough
for now.  
Goodbye, and thanks for listening.
