# Binary asset audit

## Why binaries now live in `speechdata/`
The 2025-10 restructure moves every proprietary runtime and opaque dataset out of the extension-first `assets/` tree. Staging DLLs, executables, icons, and compiled caches under `speechdata/` makes it clear that these payloads must be regenerated or replaced before publishing an NVDA add-on. Tooling inside [`assets/py/resource_paths.py`](../py/resource_paths.py) now resolves each engineâ€™s binaries from the new locations so NVDA alpha builds, CodeQL scans, and offline packaging rehearsals stay reproducible without keeping vendor blobs in the Python source tree. Refresh the per-file inventory with `python assets/py/report_binary_assets.py --json assets/json/binary_asset_index.json --markdown assets/md/binary_asset_index.md --print` whenever the tree changes so this audit can link to the latest counts.

## Inventory by engine
| Engine / payload | Directory | Binary types | Runtime status | Follow-up work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Eloquence core runtime | `speechdata/eloquence/dll/` | `ECI*.DLL`, `TI*.DLL`, locale ROM shims (`chsrom.dll`, `jpnrom.dll`, `korrom.dll`), SAPI bridges | Loaded by [`assets/py/Eloquence.py`](../py/Eloquence.py) via `resource_paths`. | Capture per-architecture checksums before bundling redistributable builds in NVDA alpha-52731 rehearsals. |
| Eloquence voices | `speechdata/eloquence/syn/` | `.SYN` voice archives | Staged into packaged add-ons by `build.py`. | Document provenance for each voice before future redistribution. |
| Eloquence UI & tooling | `speechdata/eloquence/uil/`, `speechdata/eloquence/exe/`, `speechdata/eloquence/ico/` | UI resource DLLs, legacy demos (`eloqtalk.exe`), icons | Not exercised by NVDA runtime; retained for archival research. | Determine whether UI resource DLLs are needed for compatibility with legacy installers. |
| NV Speech Player | `speechdata/nv_speech_player/dll/` | `speechPlayer.dll`, `old_speechPlayer.dll`, `SMPRenderer.dll` | Loaded by `speechPlayer.py`, `old_speechPlayer.py`, and `smpsoft.py`. | Align DLL provenance with cached NV Speech Player releases before distributing binaries. |
| SVOX Pico | `speechdata/pico/dll/`, `speechdata/pico/svox-pico-data/` | `svox-pico.dll`, `.bin` voice data | Loaded by `pico.py`. | Validate voice data against current NVDA alpha sample-rate expectations; document licensing for each language pack. |
| DECtalk / FonixTalk | `speechdata/dectalk/dll/`, `speechdata/fonixtalk/dll/` | `dectalk*.dll`, `dtalk_*.dll` | Loaded by `_dectalk.py` and `_fonixtalk.py`. | Record DataJake provenance for each DLL and confirm per-locale voice availability. |
| BestSpeech | `speechdata/bestspeech/dll/` | `B32_TTS.DLL`, `b32_wrapper.dll` | Loaded by `bestspeech.py`. | Audit whether wrapper DLLs require 32-bit compatibility notes for NVDA alpha packaging. |
| Brailab | `speechdata/brailab/dll/`, `speechdata/brailab/compiled/` | `TTS.dll`, legacy `.pyo` cache | Loaded by `brailab.py`; compiled artefacts retained for reverse-engineering. | Replace `.pyo` cache with documented source once compatibility testing completes. |
| Captain | `speechdata/captain/dll/` | `captain.dll` | Loaded by `captain.py`. | Confirm audio format expectations for NVDA 32-bit vs. 64-bit targets. |
| Gregor | `speechdata/gregor/dll/`, `speechdata/gregor/compiled/` | `libsyntgregor.dll`, legacy `.pyc`/`.pyo` cache | Loaded by `gregor.py`. | Rebuild the compiled cache from source to confirm Python 3.13 compatibility. |
| Legacy / unclassified archives | `speechdata/legacy/bin/` | Historical `.bin` voice data (e.g., `BINADATA.BIN`, `adrlong.bin`) | Not used by current loaders. | Identify the originating engine before promoting into an engine-specific bucket or regenerating replacements. |

## Outstanding actions
- Update the modernization audit with per-engine checksum guidance once NVDA alpha-52731 validation runs complete.
- Expand the CodeQL policy so binaries staged in `speechdata/` are automatically flagged when missing provenance notes.
- Continue moving extensionless datasets into typed buckets (for example, Pico dictionaries) so future packaging runs can verify licences before shipping binaries.
